#### Genome-wide identification of m6A-associated SNPs as potential functional variants for prostate cancer

* [Meta analysis summary data](http://practical.icr.ac.uk/blog/?page_id=8164): Association analyses of more than 140,000 men identify 63 new susceptibility loci
* KLK3 (19_51364623_A_G, [PSA](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P07288)) in the raw data are mistakely recorded (19_51364623_A_G NA      NA      19      51364623  3.343e-47)
* Re-code and take the first column as the id resource (19_51364623_A_G) to match db153 SNPs
